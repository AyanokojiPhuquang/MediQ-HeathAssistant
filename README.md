# MediQ - AI Healthcare Assistant

This project is an AI-powered healthcare assistant developed based on the MIMIC clinical dataset, which contains thousands of real, de-identified ICU records. By learning from this rich medical source, the model gains a more grounded understanding of symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment patterns, allowing it to provide clearer explanations, symptom checking, and general medical support.
