# MediQ - AI Healthcare Assistant
An intelligent medical chatbot built on the MIMIC clinical dataset

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an AI-powered healthcare assistant developed based on the MIMIC clinical dataset, which contains thousands of real, de-identified ICU records. By learning from this rich medical source, the model gains a more grounded understanding of symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment patterns, allowing it to provide clearer explanations, symptom checking, and general medical support. The aim is to turn the clinical knowledge embedded in MIMIC into a simple, helpful, and safe tool that users can rely on for exploring health information.
